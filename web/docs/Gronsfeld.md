## Historical Context

The Gronsfeld cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that is a variation of the Vigen√®re cipher. It was created by Count Gronsfeld, a German diplomat.

## How it Works

The Gronsfeld cipher uses a numeric key instead of a keyword. Each digit of the key determines the shift for the corresponding letter of the plaintext.
